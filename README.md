# FooBaR: Fault Fooling Backdoor Attack on Neural Network Training

Code from the IEEE TDSC 2022 paper 

There are 2 jupyter notebooks:

MLP.ipynb corresponds to the simulation on faulting a multi-layer perceptron.

CNN.ipynb corresponds to the simulation of faulting a convolutional-layer neural network.

An important prerequisite for constraint solving is to install SageMath, see:
